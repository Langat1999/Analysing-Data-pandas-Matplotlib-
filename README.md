# Wine Quality Data Analysis

![alt text][def]

This project demonstrates how to load, explore, analyze, and visualize the red and white wine quality datasets using Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Features
- Loads both red and white wine datasets from CSV files
- Cleans and explores the data (missing values, data types)
- Computes basic statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Groups and aggregates data by wine quality
- Identifies patterns and insights
- Visualizes data with:
  - Line charts
  - Bar charts
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
- All plots are customized with titles, axis labels, and legends
- Error handling for file loading and data processing

## How to Use
1. Place `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv` in the project directory.
2. Open `Wine_Quality_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
